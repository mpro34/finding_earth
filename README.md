Preface to the Game:
GAME: Finding Earth

This game will be an FPS/RPG type game where the player would travel to different worlds searching for life.

The year is 8 BYAD (8 Billion Years After Death) and Earth has been destroyed. The Sun has expanded to iHumans have escaped to various ships called "Athenas" which are related to escape-pods (no onboard weapons). Humans have grown accustomed to life in space, however even with artificial gravity, humansts Red Giant phase and has engulfed the orbit of the Earth.

 have experienced dramatic bone loss and muscle detrify. Therefore, they must live inside these pods and rarely go outside. To explore the universe, however, the company that created the Athena ship (NextGen), also created exo-skeleton suits, called exomorphs for the humans to psychically connect to via their ships. This way, humans can explore various planets are destinations through the exomorphs.

The exomorphs will have varying skills and purposes (one for mining, one for combat, etc). The challenge will be to find planets with low enough gravity and that will be able to sustain life for the rest of the human race. Beacons are equipped on all Athenas where if a human believes they have found a planet, the beacon will become activated and all nearby (within 500 Light Years) Athenas will get hailed. However, many humans have become suicidal and send out false beacons in order to hyjack another's goods or exomorphs (rare suits perhaps).

The ships will travel by light speed to different galaxys and will rest in any planet's orbit. Exomorphs will also be damaged by the weather on these various planets, thus will need to be repaired and the various human colonies around the universe. (Of course, these are created within asteroid belts or anywhere in space).
