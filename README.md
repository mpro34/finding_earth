Preface to the Game:
GAME: Finding Earth

This game will be an FPS/RPG type game where the player would travel to different worlds searching for life in the Milky Way Galaxy.

The year is 10,016 AD (After Death) and Earth has been destroyed. The Sun has burned off most of its hydrogen which in turn lead it to shine 90% brighter. The earth's moisture has burned off into its atmosphere creating a greenhouse effect that killed all remaining life on the planet. Humans have escaped to space in various ships called "Athenas" which are related to escape-pods (no onboard weapons). They have grown accustomed to life in space, however even with artificial gravity, they have experienced dramatic bone loss and muscle dystrophy. Therefore, they must live their lives within these pods, until they find a suitable planet. Due to the vastness of the Galaxy, it was determined by the interim leaders that humans must go alone in these pods in order to increase the chances of finding such a planet.

To explore the universe, however, the company that created the Athena ships (NextGen), also created exo-skeleton suits, called Exomorphs, for the humans to telepathically connect to via their ships. This way, humans can explore various planets are destinations through the Exomorphs.

The Exomorphs will have varying skills and purposes (one for mining, one for combat, etc). Every Athena will have a limited number of slots for the Exomorphs, where more rare Exomorphs will be replaced with more generic ones. The human signifies which Exomorph he or she connects to at time of deployment. The challenge will be to find planets that will be able to sustain life for the remaining human race. Beacons are equipped on all Athenas where after a inhabitable planet has been found, the beacon will become activated and all nearby (within 500 Light Years) Athenas will get hailed. However, many humans have become irrational and suicidal due to Space Madness (psychological disease caused by isolation and the vastness of the universe) and may send out false beacons in order to hyjack another's goods or exomorphs (rare suits perhaps).

3 Types of Exomorphs: Yellow Exomorph (extra reinforcement in legs) - Can jump very high and wields a weak laser pistol. Blue Exomorph (Assault class) - Can sprint, wields an assault rifle with a gravity cannon. Red Exomorph (reinforced hands and a shield) - Can destory large objects with powerful fists and protect itself with forward shields.

The ships will travel by light speed to different Solar Systems, where the planets orbit is the location from where the Exomorphs will be launched. Exomorphs will also be damaged by the weather on these various planets, thus will need to be repaired. Athenas running low on supplies can replenish from the various human colonies around the Galaxy. (Of course, these are created within asteroid belts or anywhere in space).

The Game will start with a short intro of what has happened to the earth and the Player will then start on their Athena ship. Your Athena has responded to a beacon on a nearby planet, you start by choosing your Exomorph and exploring the planet. After a brief tutorial, the player will start. Hostiles both human and alien will attack the player. Once an Exomorph has fallen, the player must choose a different one, and retrieve the old one for repair (after leaving planet). The correct Exomorph must be chosen to get over obstacles. Can teleport each Exomorph to planet upon summon at any time (as long as it's not destroyed)...

FUTURE: There will be 1-10 planets per Solar System and 2 Solar Systems in the Galaxy (Not aiming for any larger - Over 3 Trillion Galaxys in the Universe). Each Solar System will be treated as a level zone, where the player will level up. The level Cap will be 20. 10 Levels per Solar System.
